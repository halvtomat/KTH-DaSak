Switch to the proper branch for the exercise.

Current exercises are:
- hash
- buffer-overflow
- malware

* Malware
File =payload1.py= and =payload2.py= are two malicious program. It is easy
to recognize if a script contains one of these two payloads and
identify the payload version: they use variables names that are easy
to identify.
File =malware.py= is a malware that is able to inject a payload to a
victim file.

Implement the function =check= of the file =antivirus.py=. The
function should return 1 if =payload1.py= has been injected into
=filename= by =malware.py=; 2 if =payload2.py= has been injected into
=filename= by =malware.py=; =None= otherwise. Note that no matter the payload
is encrypted or not, =antivirus.py= should be able to detect it.

To test your solution execute =./test.py= or =py.test test.py=.
